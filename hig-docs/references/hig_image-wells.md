# Image wells

> An image well is an editable version of an image view.



After selecting an image well, people can copy and paste its image or delete it. People can also drag a new image into an image well without selecting it first.

## Best practices

**Revert to a default image when necessary.** If your image well requires an image, display the default image again if people clear the content of the image well.

**If your image well supports copy and paste, make sure the standard copy and paste menu items are available.** People generally expect to choose these menu items — or use the standard keyboard shortcuts — to interact with an image well. For guidance, see [Edit menu](/design/human-interface-guidelines/the-menu-bar#Edit-menu).

For related guidance, see [Image views](/design/human-interface-guidelines/image-views).
