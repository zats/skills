# Path controls

> A path control shows the file system path of a selected file or folder.



For example, choosing View > Show Path Bar in the Finder displays a path bar at the bottom of the window. It shows the path of the selected item, or the path of the window’s folder if nothing is selected.

There are two styles of path control.

## Best practices

**Use a path control in the window body, not the window frame.** Path controls aren’t intended for use in toolbars or status bars. Note that the path control in the Finder appears at the bottom of the window body, not in the status bar.

## Platform considerations

*Not supported in iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, or watchOS.*
