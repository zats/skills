# Menus

> A menu reveals its options when people interact with it, making it a space-efficient way to present commands in your app or game.



Menus are ubiquitous in apps and games, so most people already know how to use them. Whether you use system-provided components or custom ones, people expect menus to behave in familiar ways. For example, people understand that opening a menu reveals one or more *menu items*, each of which represents a command, option, or state that affects the current selection or context. The guidance for labeling and organizing menu items applies to all types of menus in all experiences.

## Labels

A menu item’s label describes what it does and may include a symbol if it helps to clarify meaning. In an app, a menu item can also display the associated keyboard command, if there is one; in a game, a menu item rarely displays a keyboard command because a game typically needs to handle input from a wider range of devices and may offer game-specific mappings for various keys.

**For each menu item, write a label that clearly and succinctly describes it.** In general, label a menu item that initiates an action using a verb or verb phrase that describes the action, such as View, Close, or Select. For guidance labeling menu items that show and hide something in the interface or show the currently selected state of something, see [Toggled items](/design/human-interface-guidelines/menus#Toggled-items). As with all the copy you write, let your app’s or game’s communication style guide the tone of the menu-item labels you create.

**To be consistent with platform experiences, use title-style capitalization.** Although a game might have a different writing style, generally prefer using title-style capitalization, which capitalizes every word except articles, coordinating conjunctions, and short prepositions, and capitalizes the last word in the label, regardless of the part of speech. For complete guidance on this style of capitalization in English, see [title-style capitalization](https://support.apple.com/guide/applestyleguide/c-apsgb744e4a3/web#apdca93e113f1d64).

**Remove articles like *a*, *an*, and *the* from menu-item labels to save space.** In English, articles always lengthen labels, but rarely enhance understanding. For example, changing a menu-item label from  View Settings to View the Settings doesn’t provide additional clarification.

**Show people when a menu item is unavailable.** An unavailable menu item often appears dimmed and doesn’t respond to interactions. If all of a menu’s items are unavailable, the menu itself needs to remain available so people can open it and learn about the commands it contains.

**Append an ellipsis to a menu item’s label when the action requires more information before it can complete.** The ellipsis character (…) signals that people need to input information or make additional choices, typically within another view.

## Icons

**Represent menu item actions with familiar icons.** Icons help people recognize common actions throughout your app. Use the same icons as the system to represent actions such as Copy, Share, and Delete, wherever they appear. For a list of icons that represent common actions, see [Standard icons](/design/human-interface-guidelines/icons#Standard-icons).

**Don’t display an icon if you can’t find one that clearly represents the menu item.** Not all menu items need an icon. Be careful when adding icons for custom menu items to avoid confusion with other existing actions, and don’t add icons just for the sake of ornamentation.

**Use a single icon to introduce a group of similar items.** Instead of adding individual icons for each action, or reusing the same icon for all of them, establish a common theme with the symbol for the first item and rely on the menu item text to keep the remaining items distinct.

## Organization

Organizing menu items in ways that reflect how people use your app or game can make your experience feel straightforward and easy to use.

**Prefer listing important or frequently used menu items first.** People tend to start scanning a menu from the top, so listing high-priority items first often means that people can find what they want without reading the entire menu.

**Consider grouping logically related items.** For example, grouping editing commands like Copy, Cut, and Paste or camera commands like Look Up, Look Down, and Look Left can help people remember where to find them. To help people visually distinguish such groups, use a separator. Depending on the platform and type of menu, a *separator* appears between groups of items as a horizontal line or a short gap in the menu’s background appearance.

**Prefer keeping all logically related commands in the same group, even if the commands don’t all have the same importance.** For example, people generally use Paste and Match Style much less often than they use Paste, but they expect to find both commands in the same group that contains more frequently used editing commands like Copy and Cut.

**Be mindful of menu length.** People need more time and attention to read a long menu, which means they may miss the command they want. If a menu is too long, consider dividing it into separate menus. Alternatively, you might be able to use a submenu to shorten the list, such as listing difficulty levels in a submenu of a New Game menu item. The exception is when a menu contains user-defined or dynamically generated content, like the History and Bookmarks menus in Safari. People expect such a menu to accommodate all the items they add to it, so a long menu is fine, and scrolling is acceptable.

## Submenus

Sometimes, a menu item can reveal a set of closely related items in a subordinate list called a *submenu*. A menu item indicates the presence of a submenu by displaying a symbol — like a chevron — after its label. Submenus are functionally identical to menus, aside from their hierarchical positioning.

**Use submenus sparingly.** Each submenu adds complexity to the interface and hides the items it contains. You might consider creating a submenu when a term appears in more than two menu items in the same group. For example, instead of offering separate menu items for Sort by Date, Sort by Score, and Sort by Time, a game could present a menu item that uses a submenu to list the sorting options Date, Score, and Time. It generally works well to use the repeated term — in this case, *Sort by* — in the menu item’s label to help people predict the contents of the submenu.

**Limit the depth and length of submenus.** It can be difficult for people to reveal multiple levels of hierarchical submenus, so it’s generally best to restrict them to a single level. Also, if a submenu contains more than about five items, consider creating a new menu.

**Make sure a submenu remains available even when its nested menu items are unavailable.** A submenu item — like all menu items — needs to let people open it and learn about the commands it contains.

**Prefer using a submenu to indenting menu items.** Using indentation is inconsistent with the system and doesn’t clearly express the relationships between the menu items.

## Toggled items

Menu items often represent attributes or objects that people can turn on or off. If you want to avoid listing a separate menu item for each state, it can be efficient to create a single, toggled menu item that communicates the current state and lets people change it.

**Consider using a changeable label that describes an item’s current state.** For example, instead of listing two menu items like Show Map and Hide Map, you could include one menu item whose label changes from Show Map to Hide Map, depending on whether the map is visible.

**Include a verb if a changeable label isn’t clear enough.** For example, people might not know whether the changeable labels HDR On and HDR Off describe actions or states. If you needed to clarify that these items represent actions, you could add verbs to the labels, like Turn HDR On and Turn HDR Off.

**If necessary, display both menu items instead of one toggled item.** Sometimes, it helps people to view both actions or states at the same time. For example, a game could list both Take Account Online and Take Account Offline items, so when someone’s account is online, only the Take Account Offline menu item appears available.

**Consider using a checkmark to show that an attribute is currently in effect.** It’s easy for people to scan for checkmarks in a list of attributes to find the ones that are selected. For example, in the standard Format > Font menu, checkmarks can make it easy for people notice the styles that apply to selected text.

**Consider offering a menu item that makes it easy to remove multiple toggled attributes.** For example, if you let people apply several styles to selected text, it can work well to provide a menu item — such as Plain — that removes all applied formatting attributes at one time.

## In-game menus

In-game menus give players ways to control gameplay as well as determine [settings](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/settings) for the game as a whole.

**Let players navigate in-game menus using the platform’s default interaction method.** People expect to use the same interactions to navigate your menus as they use for navigating other menus on the device. For example, players expect to navigate your game menus using touch in iOS and iPadOS, and direct and indirect gestures in visionOS.

**Make sure your menus remain easy to open and read on all platforms you support.** Each platform defines specific sizes that work best for fonts and interaction targets. Sometimes, scaling your game content to display on a different screen — especially a mobile device screen — can make in-game menus too small for people to read or interact with. If this happens, modify the size of the tap targets and consider alternative ways to communicate the menu’s content. For guidance, see [Typography](/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography) and [Touch controls](/design/human-interface-guidelines/game-controls#Touch-controls).

## Platform considerations

*No additional considerations for macOS, tvOS, or watchOS.*

### iOS, iPadOS

In iOS and iPadOS, a menu can display items in one of the following three layouts.



- **Small.** A row of four items appears at the top of the menu, above a list that contains the remaining items. For each item in the top row, the menu displays a symbol or icon, but no label.
- **Medium.** A row of three items appears at the top of the menu, above a list that contains the remaining items. For each item in the top row, the menu displays a symbol or icon above a short label.
- **Large (the default).** The menu displays all items in a list.

For developer guidance, see [preferredElementSize](/documentation/UIKit/UIMenu/preferredElementSize).

**Choose a small or medium menu layout when it can help streamline people’s choices.** Consider using the medium layout if your app has three important actions that people often want to perform. For example, Notes uses the medium layout to give people a quick way to perform the Scan, Lock, and Pin actions. Use the small layout only for closely related actions that typically appear as a group, such as Bold, Italic, Underline, and Strikethrough. For each action, use a recognizable symbol that helps people identify the action without a label.

### visionOS

In visionOS, a menu can display items using the small or large layout styles that iOS and iPadOS define (for guidance, see [iOS, iPadOS](/design/human-interface-guidelines/menus#iOS-iPadOS)). You can present a menu in your app or game from 3D content using a SwiftUI view. To ensure that your menu is always visible to people, even when other content occludes it, you can apply a [breakthrough effect](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/presentationbreakthrougheffect(_:)). As in macOS, an open menu in a visionOS window can appear outside of the window’s boundaries.

**Prefer displaying a menu near the content it controls.** Because people need to look at a menu item before tapping it, they might miss the item’s effect if the content it controls is too far away.



**Prefer the subtle breakthrough effect in most cases.** This effect blends the presentation with its surrounding content, to maintain legibility and usability while preserving the depth and context of the scene. When you select [automatic](/documentation/SwiftUI/BreakthroughEffect/automatic) for the breakthrough effect of a menu that overlaps with 3D content, the system applies [subtle](/documentation/SwiftUI/BreakthroughEffect/subtle) by default. You can use [prominent](/documentation/SwiftUI/BreakthroughEffect/prominent) if it’s important to display a menu prominently over the entire scene in your app or game, but this can disrupt the experience for people and potentially cause discomfort. Alternatively, you can use [none](/documentation/SwiftUI/BreakthroughEffect/none) to fully occlude your menu behind other 3D content — for example, in a puzzle game that requires people to navigate around barriers — but this may make it difficult for people to see and access the menu.
