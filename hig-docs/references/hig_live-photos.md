# Live Photos

> Live Photos lets people capture favorite memories in a sound- and motion-rich interactive experience that adds vitality to traditional still photos.



When Live Photos is available, the Camera app captures additional content — including audio and extra frames — before and after people take a photo. People press a Live Photo to see it spring to life.

## Best practices

**Apply adjustments to all frames.** If your app lets people apply effects or adjustments to a Live Photo, make sure those changes are applied to the entire photo. If you don’t support this, give people the option of converting it to a still photo.

**Keep Live Photo content intact.** It’s important for people to experience Live Photos in a consistent way that uses the same visual treatment and interaction model across all apps. Don’t disassemble a Live Photo and present its frames or audio separately.

**Implement a great photo sharing experience.** If your app supports photo sharing, let people preview the entire contents of Live Photos before deciding to share. Always offer the option to share Live Photos as traditional photos.

**Clearly indicate when a Live Photo is downloading and when the photo is playable.** Show a progress indicator during the download process and provide some indication when the download is complete.

**Display Live Photos as traditional photos in environments that don’t support Live Photos.** Don’t attempt to replicate the Live Photos experience provided in a supported environment. Instead, show a traditional, still representation of the photo.

**Make Live Photos easily distinguishable from still photos.** The best way to identify a Live Photo is through a hint of movement. Because there are no built-in Live Photo motion effects, like the one that appears as you swipe through photos in the full-screen browser of Photos app, you need to design and implement custom motion effects.

In cases where movement isn’t possible, show a system-provided badge above the photo, either with or without text. Never include a playback button that a viewer can interpret as a video playback button.

**Keep badge placement consistent.** If you show a badge, put it in the same location on every photo. Typically, a badge looks best in a corner of a photo.

## Platform considerations

*No additional considerations for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, or tvOS. Not supported in watchOS.*
