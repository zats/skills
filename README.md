# Skills Repo

This directory holds Codex skills—self-contained folders (each with a `SKILL.md` and optional helpers) that extend the agent's abilities.

Included skills:
- `codex-changelog`: checks the installed Codex CLI version and fetches the matching GitHub Releases changelog.
- `learn`: captures user corrections/preferences during a session and writes durable notes to `AGENTS.md` so future turns follow them.
